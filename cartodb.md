# Working with CartoDB

## Create an account

Go to https://cartodb.com/signup to create an account (if you don't already have one). Free accounts allow you to upload 50 MB of data, but keep in mind that all your data and maps will be public.

## Login

Once logged in, you will see your private dashboard. This is where you can upload data, create maps and manage your account.

At the top left is a dropdown menu where you can select either **Maps** (default) or **Datasets**. At the top right, there is a tab that wil take you to documentation for the CartoDB Editor.

You also have a public page at https://user.cartodb.com/maps. All the maps that you create will be visible there.

## Uploading data

For this exercise, we're going to use an extremly simple dataset, [Edinburgh Trees with a Story](http://edinburghopendata.info/dataset/edinburgh-s-trees-with-a-story). 

If you navigate to the Datasets tab, you should see a screen like the following:

Click on the link in the centre of the screen that says **connect dataset**, and you'll then see a screen like this:

Download the data from [here](http://edinburghopendata.info/dataset/8f46d456-3115-41f0-bef5-f45de1909608/resource/e61ee62b-e58a-413b-8079-f9b3ee4e219a/download/edinburghstreeswithastory.csv).

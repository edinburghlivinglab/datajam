# Odyssey.js


## Create a story

Head to http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/ and choose the **Create Story** button. This will take you to the Sandbox Editor, where you can select one of three templates. 

* **Slides** provides a very large map window with a small box to put small amounts of descriptive text. This template is appropriate for stories where sequential events aren’t very important. 

* **Scroll** seems best suited to more in-depth stories, like full blogs or articles where the text at least as important as the map. 

* **Torque**  is similar to **Slides**, but includes the capability to visualize changes over time in point-based data.


## Adding New Slides With Markdown

Once you’ve chosen a template, the Sandbox Editor comes pre-filled with boilerplate text and directions on how to format everything correctly. The editor itself uses Markdown formatting, and each new “slide” can be created with a simple “#”, which tells Markdown that you are using a heading &mdash; in fact the highest heading level. 

New slides denoted by a “#” will have a small “add” icon that appears to the left of the text. Clicking will display options to drop a marker, tell the map to pan and zoom to a certain location, or “sleep”, which is used for Torque visualizations.
